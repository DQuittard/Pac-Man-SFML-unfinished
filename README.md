Pacman project made for my school.
I had less than 2 months of total work on this (solo project), and due to time constraints it's not finished.
It's made in C++ with the SFML, a C++ framework.

It's only available on Linux with a makefile because of time constraints.

The file maptest.txt can be edited to change the level !
0 are walls, and 1 are gums that Pac-Man eats, adding to your score.
